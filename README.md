# StarSoft Web Source Code
This is a first web i developed in 2017 when i was 13. I want to make it open-source because i don't have any use for that. So enjoy my crappy code. Btw the "company" we used to say, does not exist right now, we shut it down in 2019. After this, we used WordPress because of easier management.

I provided some of our programs that might be useful.

I will NOT update this project.
