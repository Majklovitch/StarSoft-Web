# StarSoft Web Source Code
This is a first web i developed in 2017 when i was 13. I want to make it open-source because i don't have any use for it. So enjoy my crappy code :) Btw the "company" we used to say, doesn't exist right now, we shut it down in 2019. After this, we used WordPress because of easier management.

I even provided some of our programs that might be useful.

I will NOT update this project.
